		<description><![CDATA[A 91 year old volunteer of the soccercclub svBabberich in the Netherlands cycles 20km twice a week from his homecity to the club. Thanks to the cycle infrastructure. For three years he did it safe on a normal bike but he fell a few times. Now he is little (but no to!) happy with his trike.

		<description><![CDATA[I am 60 years old and recently retired I now cycle for pleasure at least 3 times a week. I find that getting around Cardiff is a problem although there are many cycle routes they are not well policed and in many areas cars parking in cycling lanes cause many issues Canton being a regular dangerous area for cyclists. 
I have found a good route now which takes in some road cycling with no  cycle lanes and then off the main road along the cycle lanes around Avondale Road then around the bay and over the barrage.
I also enjoy cycling in and around Sophia Gardens but Newport Road can be a bit daunting some times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m 61, female and still working (at home, freelancer) and have always cycled. I hate driving so I use my bike (a Trek hybrid) for short trips into town but having moved to Cornwall and having a largely sedentary job I have been starting to ride purely for fun and to keep fit. It&#039;s very hilly here and any trip involves a stiff workout! 

Currently my longest solo ride has been about 10 miles. I&#039;m reluctant to stretch it further until I am sure in my head that I know what to do to change an inner tube and get derraileur gears back on correctly. I&#039;m not very good mechanically. Hubby is helping in that respect, he&#039;s 54 and regularly does much longer trips and enters sportives of 100 miles or more, so I get lots of encouragement! 

I tend not to cycle in the town centre so much, as I&#039;m not confident of the use of cycle lanes on main roads. They seem to stop and start and change sides and I have never used one. They never had them years ago when I cycled to and from work in a busy town. My rides involve mostly rural roads, not too busy and often single-vehicle size and are hilly. The views range across both Cornish coasts at the same time, my true incentive to cycle.

My contemporaries&#039; attitude to me cycling &#039;at my age&#039; (!) ranges from bemusement to respect LOL. To be honest, most of them are starting to have health problems due to their size but won&#039;t consider cycling as they see it as hard work, which is a shame because I&#039;d love a cycle buddy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am 68 and retired, and like to cycle. As above most of my journeys are shopping, round trips between 3 and 6 miles. I like to take a longer rides but hate riding on roads because one is often cut up by vehicles passing too close or not giving way. Although we have lots of cycle tracks around Bradley Stoke/Stoke Gifford, for the longer rides there are often no routes that provide a mainly off road round trip. For example it would be good to use the Concorde way to Bristol then the Jubillee way to link up to the Strawberry way and back to Bradley Stoke. So my longer rides tend to be the same ones. Also South Glos doesn&#039;t seem to like cyclists, they put in a new cycle path and put give way lines to cyclists so motorists can exit a car park. Not exactly cycling friendly. They do have a cyclist&#039;s forum but items raised by cyclists remain ignored for years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this interesting view of Amsterdam. A pity you didn&#039;t manage to get out of the centre more. Because that is not the most interesting part from an infrastructural point of view. You mention Nescio Bridge, but I understand you didn&#039;t get to see it in person. Your link to the post about it does not work unfortunately,  but that gives me the opportunity to point to the new location of that story. It can now be found: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2011/10/06/nescio-bridge-amsterdam/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
