		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this interesting view of Amsterdam. A pity you didn&#039;t manage to get out of the centre more. Because that is not the most interesting part from an infrastructural point of view. You mention Nescio Bridge, but I understand you didn&#039;t get to see it in person. Your link to the post about it does not work unfortunately,  but that gives me the opportunity to point to the new location of that story. It can now be found: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2011/10/06/nescio-bridge-amsterdam/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
